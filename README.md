# About

The Clicky Game is a game built with React.js. The goal of the game is to click through all the images without repating them and gain a personal high score.

All the images will re-shuffle after every click, so you must remember what you clicked!

The game keeps track of your score at the top, and maintains the top score ahieved in your session.
